- **Python**: 3.10 or higher
- **Node.js**: 18.x or higher
- **OpenAI API Key**: For AI features

**Note:** This app requires ERPNext to be installed. It will not work with Frappe-only installations.

## üì¶ Installation

### Method 1: Using bench (Recommended)

```bash
# Navigate to your bench directory
cd /path/to/your/bench

# Get the app from GitHub
bench get-app https://github.com/WIKKIwk/erpnext_ai.git

# Install the app on your site
bench --site your-site-name install-app erpnext_ai

# Migrate and build
bench --site your-site-name migrate
bench build
```

### Method 2: Manual installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
cd apps
git clone https://github.com/WIKKIwk/erpnext_ai.git

# Install dependencies
cd erpnext_ai
pip install -e .

# Install the app on your site
cd ../..
bench --site your-site-name install-app erpnext_ai
```

### Method 3: Provision a Fresh Bench on Ubuntu

If you need a brand-new ERPNext environment, this repository ships with `install_erpnext.sh`. It installs all dependencies on Ubuntu 22.04/24.04, sets up Bench, creates a site, and installs ERPNext.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WIKKIwk/erpnext_ai/master/install_erpnext.sh | sudo bash
```

Environment variables such as `TARGET_USER`, `BENCH_NAME`, `SITE_NAME`, `FRAPPE_BRANCH`, `ERPNEXT_BRANCH`, and `SITE_ADMIN_PASSWORD` can be exported before running the script to customise the installation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### 1. Assign Roles

Assign the new **AI Manager** role to users who should access AI reports. System Managers retain full access automatically.

### 2. Configure OpenAI API Key

**Recommended:** Add to bench-level `.env` file:

```bash
# In your bench directory, edit or create .env file
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-api-key-here
```

**Alternative:** Configure via UI in **AI Settings** (`Desk ‚Üí Build ‚Üí Chatting with AI ‚Üí AI Settings`)

### 3. Configure AI Settings

Navigate to **AI Settings** and configure:

- **Provider**: OpenAI (default)
- **Model**: Choose from:
  - `gpt-4o` - Most capable (recommended for production)
  - `gpt-4o-mini` - Cost-effective option
  - `gpt-5` - Latest model (if available)
  - `gpt-5-mini` - Fast and efficient
- **Timeout**: Request timeout in seconds (default: 30)
- **Prompt Template**: Customize the AI summary style

### 4. Start Scheduler

The app includes a daily scheduler task for automatic admin summaries:

```bash
# Development
bench start

# Production (supervisor will handle this automatically)
sudo systemctl restart supervisor
```

## üöÄ Usage

### AI Admin Summary

1. Navigate to **Desk ‚Üí Build ‚Üí Chatting with AI**
2. Click "Generate Summary" to create an instant report
3. Daily summaries are automatically generated via scheduler

### AI Chat

1. Open **AI Chat** workspace
2. Start a conversation with the AI assistant
3. All messages are stored in `AI Conversation` records
4. Context from ERPNext is automatically included

### Access Reports

- Navigate to **AI Report** DocType to view all generated reports
- Filter by date, user, or report type
- Export reports as needed

## üì± Telegram Bot Integration

The app includes an optional Telegram bot for sales team integration.

### Setup

1. **Create a Telegram Bot:**
   - Message [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) on Telegram
   - Use `/newbot` command and follow instructions
   - Copy the bot token

2. **Configure Environment Variables:**

```bash
# Add to bench .env file
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your-bot-token-here
TELEGRAM_ADMIN_IDS=123456789,987654321
FRAPPE_BASE_URL=https://your-erp-domain.com

# Optional security hardening
BOT_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-32-byte-base64-key
TELEGRAM_BOT_DB_PATH=/path/to/telegram_bot.db
```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -e apps/erpnext_ai
```

4. **Run the Bot:**

```bash
# From bench directory
bench --site your-site-name execute erpnext_ai.erpnext_ai.telegram.bot.main

# Or using systemd/supervisor (recommended for production)
# Create a service file that runs the above command
```

### Bot Workflow

1. **Admin Setup:**
   - Admin sends `/add_master_manager <telegram_id>` to bot in private chat
   - This registers a sales master manager

2. **Master Manager Setup:**
   - Sales master manager joins target groups
   - Runs `/users` command in group
   - Selects future sales manager from inline list

3. **Sales Manager Setup:**
   - Sales manager receives DM from bot
   - Runs `/set_api <api_key> <api_secret>` to connect ERPNext account
   - Credentials are verified and stored encrypted

4. **Team Usage:**
   - `/report` - View recent ERPNext sales data
   - `/order` - Submit structured order request
   - Orders are saved as ERPNext Leads and logged locally

### Bot Commands

- `/start` - Initialize bot
- `/help` - Show help message
- `/users` - Select sales manager (master managers only)
- `/set_api` - Configure ERPNext credentials
- `/report` - Generate sales report
- `/order` - Submit new order
- `/add_master_manager` - Add master manager (admins only)

## üóÇÔ∏è DocTypes

The app creates the following DocTypes:

| DocType | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **AI Settings** | Global configuration for AI features |
| **AI Report** | Stores generated admin summaries |
| **AI Conversation** | Chat history and context |
| **AI Message** | Individual messages in conversations |

## üìÖ Scheduled Tasks

- **Daily**: `generate_daily_admin_summary` - Creates automated admin summary

## üîß Development

### Setup Development Environment

```bash
cd apps/erpnext_ai
pre-commit install
```

### Code Quality Tools

The app uses pre-commit hooks for code quality:

- **ruff** - Python linting and formatting
- **eslint** - JavaScript linting
- **prettier** - Code formatting
- **pyupgrade** - Python syntax modernization

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
bench --site your-site-name run-tests --app erpnext_ai

# Run specific test
bench --site your-site-name run-tests --app erpnext_ai --module path.to.test
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### AI Features Not Working

1. Verify OpenAI API key is set correctly
2. Check AI Settings configuration
3. Review logs: `bench --site your-site-name console`

### Telegram Bot Not Responding

1. Verify `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` is set
2. Check bot is running: `ps aux | grep telegram`
3. Review bot logs
4. Ensure bot is added to group as administrator

### Scheduler Not Running

1. Check scheduler is enabled: `bench --site your-site-name doctor`
2. Verify services are running: `sudo supervisorctl status`
3. Check scheduler logs: `tail -f sites/your-site-name/logs/scheduler.log`

### Dependencies Issues

```bash
# Reinstall dependencies
pip install -e apps/erpnext_ai --force-reinstall

# Clear cache
bench --site your-site-name clear-cache
```
